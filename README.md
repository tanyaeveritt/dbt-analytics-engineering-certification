*   **Defer, State, and Clone:** Understand the differences between these concepts. These came up so often.
*   **Test vs. Model Contracts:** Know the difference between test contracts and model contracts, and understand the difference between generic and singular tests.
*   **Tests, generic, custom generic** how its written and referenced, yml, sql
*   **Upstream and Downstream:** Familiarize yourself with the flow of data from source to staging and then into the marts, with multiple models feeding into the marts. Union, joins
